# House Of Code Challenge - Phase 1

This directory contains my solutions for **Phase 1** of the **"House of Code"** challenge, created by the **Club of IAE** at the **University of Ibn Zohr, Ait Melloul**. This phase focuses on fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving skills.

## 🛠 Rules

- **No Built-in Functions**: Standard library functions (except those from `stdio.h`) are not allowed.
- **Manual Implementations**: All required functionalities are implemented from scratch.

## 💡 Solutions

Each solution is implemented in C and addresses a specific problem from the challenge.

### 📌 List of Solutions

1. **Exercise 1: Custom `strlen` Function**
   - 📜 **Description**: Implement a function that calculates the length of a string, similar to the standard `strlen` function in C.
   - 📂 **File**: `01-strlen.c`

2. **Exercise 2: Custom `strrev` Function**
   - 📜 **Description**: Create a function that reverses a string, similar to the standard `strrev` function.
   - 📂 **File**: `02-ReverseString.c`

3. **Exercise 3: Reverse Words in a String**
   - 📜 **Description**: Write a function that reverses the order of words in a string.  
     **Example**: `"I love coding"` → `"coding love I"`
   - 📂 **File**: `03-ReverseWords.c`

## ▶️ How to Run

To compile and run any of the solutions, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc -o solution 01-strlen.c
./solution
```
Replace `01-strlen.c` with the filename of the exercise you want to test.
