# House Of Code Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the "House of Code" challenge, a series of programming tasks organized by the Club of IAE at the University of Ibn Zohr, Ait Melloul. The challenge consists of four phases, each increasing in difficulty.

## 🏆 Phases

### Phase 1 - Fundamentals 🔰
- Focuses on basic programming concepts and problem-solving skills.

### Phase 2 - Algorithms & Data Structures 📚
- Introduces more complex problems requiring knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

### Phase 3 - Optimization & Advanced Problems 🚀
- Requires efficient solutions with a focus on algorithm optimization.

### Phase 4 - Expert Challenges 💡
- The most challenging phase, testing advanced problem-solving skills and performance optimization.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is structured into directories for each phase, with solutions following the naming format `XX-solution.c`, where `XX` is the problem number.
